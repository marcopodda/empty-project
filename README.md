# Empty Project

A stub for a deep learning project using the directory structure and the dependencies that I usually need. It uses `pytorch-lightning` for development, `pytorch-geometric` in case I need to learn from graphs, and `hydra` for configuration management.

## Installation

Assuming the Conda package manager is installed in your machine, run:

    conda env create -n <env_name> -f CONDA/env.yaml

where `<env_name>` is a name of your choice to identify the environment.
